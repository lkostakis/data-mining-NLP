When I saw they would be showing infamous eggs of the House of Faberge from the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts (VMFA), I knew I had to go!\\\\n\\\\nTucked away near the gelateria and the garden, the Gallery is pretty much hidden from view. It\\'s what real estate agents would call \\\\\"cozy\\\\\" or \\\\\"charming\\\\\" - basically any euphemism for small.\\\\n\\\\nThat being said, you can still see wonderful art at a gallery of any size, so why the two *s you ask? Let me tell you:\\\\n\\\\n* pricing for this, while relatively inexpensive for a Las Vegas attraction, is completely over the top. For the space and the amount of art you can fit in there, it is a bit much.\\\\n* it\\'s not kid friendly at all. Seriously, don\\'t bring them.\\\\n* the security is not trained properly for the show. When the curating and design teams collaborate for exhibitions, there is a definite flow. That means visitors should view the art in a certain sequence, whether it be by historical period or cultural significance (this is how audio guides are usually developed). When I arrived in the gallery I could not tell where to start, and security was certainly not helpful. I was told to \\\\\"just look around\\\\\" and \\\\\"do whatever.\\\\\" \\\\n\\\\nAt such a *fine* institution, I find the lack of knowledge and respect for the art appalling.\",\"date\":\"2015-04-15 05:21:16\"}\\n']\n"
